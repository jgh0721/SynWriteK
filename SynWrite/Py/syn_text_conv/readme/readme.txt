command plugin for Synwrite. 
It gives same function as SW's menu of text converters (see help topic in SW):
shows menu of converters from folder "Data\conv", for each converter 2 items 
(encode/decode, decode means "backward converting"), and then calls SW's 
internal code for selected converter (code in Delphi).
