<h2>Plugin "SynLint"</h2>
<p>This is command+event plugin for SynWrite editor.<br />
It allows to check/validate syntax of  current file, for many lexers.
Each lexer/language must be supported with additionally installed subplugins:
</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript supported with subplugin based on JSLint tool,
<li>HTML supported with subplugin based on HTML Tidy tool,
<li>CSS supported with subplugin based on CSSLint tool,
<li>etc...
</ul>

<p>You will find all subplugins at our
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/synwrite-addons/files/PyPlugins/" target="_blank">Plugins site</a>.
Just download needed subplugin, install its zip-file (by opening zip-file in SynWrite),
and see its readme - maybe EXE and DLL files are needed for this subplugin - these files need to be copied into
subfolder "PyTools" of SynWrite install folder.
</p>

<p>To call validation, use "SynLint" command in "Tools - Plugins" menu.
You will see status-bar message, which tells how much errors validation found.
For each found error, you'll see yellow or red bookmark on error line (these are usual unnumbered bookmarks, so use standard commands to work with them).
Plugin also shows "Validation" panel if errors found, so you can jump to them by dbl-click.
</p>

<p>Also, validation can be called automatically by events: on opening file,
on saving file, on changing text. SynLint is not configured for these events by default (to not slowdown usual work). 
</p>


<br />
<h2>How to install</h2>
<p>Just open zip-file with plugin in SynWrite, and confirm installation.<br />
</p>

<h4>To assign hotkey for validation:</h4> 

<ul>
<li>call menu command "Options - Advanced - Edit file SynPlugins.ini";
<li>search for SynLint line in section [Commands], and add hotkey, example for Alt+A:<br />
<textarea cols="75" rows="1" readonly="readonly">
SynLint=py:syn_lint;run;;Alt+A;
</textarea>
<li>restart SynWrite.
</ul>

<h4>To make SynLint active for editor events (mentioned above):</h4>

<ul>
<li>call menu "Options - Advanved - Edit file SynPlugins.ini", file SynPlugins.ini will open;
<li>search for section [Events] or add it; add line in this section with comma-separated list of any of these event ids: on_open, on_save, on_change_slow; example: 
<br />
<textarea cols="80" rows="1" readonly="readonly">
SynLint=py:syn_lint;on_open,on_save,on_change_slow;;
</textarea>
<li>you may adjust above line with lexer names, for which events will be handled; example for lexers CSS and HTML:
<br />
<textarea cols="80" rows="1" readonly="readonly">
SynLint=py:syn_lint;on_open,on_save,on_change_slow;HTML documents,Style sheets;
</textarea>
<li>restart SynWrite.
</ul>

<p>Tech note:<br />
all subplugins folders must be named as "syn_lint_nnnnn" (where "nnnnn" is any name), otherwise
subplugin will not be found by SynLint.</p>
