<h2>Plugin "JS Format"</h2>
<p>This is command plugin for SynWrite editor.<br />
It allows to format source code for lexers JavaScript and JSON, using Python engine from 
<a href="http://jsbeautifier.org/" target="_blank">jsbeautifier.org</a>.
If selection is made (only normal selection supported) then only selection is formatted,
otherwise entire file is formatted.
</p>

<p>Plugin has few commands in SynWrite menu "Tools - Plugins". 
</p>


<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Plugin has configuration file "jsformat.cfg", which can be edited using two "Configure" commands.
</p>

<ul>
<li>"Configure" opens config-file from plugin's folder, which is used when local file doesn't exist.
<li>"Configure (local)" opens config-file from the folder of currently active SynWrite file. 
If local file doesn't exist, command suggests to copy global file into local name, and then opens it. 
</ul>
