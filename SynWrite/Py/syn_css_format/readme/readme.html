<h2>Plugin "CSS Format"</h2>
<p>This is command plugin for SynWrite editor.<br />
It allows to format CSS source code (lexer "Style sheets"), using Python engine by
author of <a href="http://jsbeautifier.org/" target="_blank">jsbeautifier.org</a>.
If selection is made (only normal selection supported) then only selection is formatted,
otherwise entire file is formatted.
</p>

<p>Plugin has few commands in SynWrite menu "Tools - Plugins". 
</p>


<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Plugin has configuration file "cssformat.cfg", which can be edited using two "Configure" commands.
</p>

<ul>
<li>"Configure" opens config-file from plugin's folder, which is used when local file doesn't exist.
<li>"Configure (local)" opens config-file from the folder of currently active SynWrite file. 
If local file doesn't exist, command suggests to copy global file into local name, and then opens it. 
</ul>

<h2>How to install</h2>
<p>Just open plugin's zip-file in SynWrite, and confirm installation.<br />
Default hotkey Ctrl+Alt+D can be changed using SynWrite command "Options - Advanced - Edit file SynPlugins.ini".
